# Toggl Unofficial

This is a small extension I've built for [Raycast](https://raycast.com), designed to allow easy starting/stopping of Toggl timers.

## Actions
- Start Toggl Timer
	- currently relies on a .ts file with an object of timers
	- will rework to automatically grab recent entries/use user-set JSON file
- Stop Toggl Timer (not completed)
- Today's Toggl Stats (not completed)

## Preferences
- Your Toggl API token
