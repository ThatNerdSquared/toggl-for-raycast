# Toggl Unofficial

This is a small extension I've built for [Raycast](https://raycast.com), designed to allow easy starting/stopping of Toggl timers. 

I'll be submitting this extension to the Raycast Store shortly, so check back in a day or two for the published version.

## Actions
- Start Toggl Timer
    - automatically retrieves unique time entries from the last 30 days
- Stop Toggl Timer (not completed)
- Create Toggl Timer (not completed)
- Today's Toggl Stats (not completed)

## Preferences
- Your Toggl API token
